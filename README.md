# FADS-Flink

This is an implementation of the [FADS-k-anonymization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705113000877) framework meant for data streams. It stems from my bachelor's thesis at [TUB](https://www.tu.berlin/).  
The aims of this thesis were to:  
1. Explore the meaning of k-anonymization in the context of data streams.
2. Implement and benchmark two frameworks that are meant for the purpose of k-anonymizing data streams.  
    This also includes the [CASTLE-Framework](https://github.com/augustinkrause/CASTLE-Flink).  
3. Propose, implement, and benchmark fixes and improvements for these frameworks.  

This expected date of completion of this project is the **13.01.2023**.
